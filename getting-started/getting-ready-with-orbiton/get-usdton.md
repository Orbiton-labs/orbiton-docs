To get $TON (TON tokens) into your TON Wallet, youâ€™ll need to follow a few steps to either buy, transfer, or earn TON from various sources. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to deposit $TON into your TON wallet:

***

## Step 1: Find Your TON Wallet Address

To receive $TON tokens, you'll need to share your **TON wallet address**. Here's how you can find it:

1. Open your **TON Wallet** app.
2. Navigate to the **main screen** of your wallet.
3. You should see your **TON wallet address** (a long string of letters and numbers). This is the address that you'll provide to others or use to receive TON.

## Step 2: Choose a Method to Get $TON Tokens

There are several ways to get $TON into your wallet:

#### **Method 1: Buying $TON from an Exchange**

1. **Create an Account on a Cryptocurrency Exchange**:
   * If you don't already have one, youâ€™ll need to create an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that supports $TON, such as:
     * **Binance**
     * **KuCoin**
     * **Gate.io**
     * **Huobi**
2. **Deposit Funds into Your Exchange Account**:
   * Deposit funds into your exchange account using a payment method of your choice (bank transfer, credit card, etc.).
3. **Buy $TON**:
   * Once your account is funded, search for $TON (TON) in the exchangeâ€™s market section.
   * Place an order to buy $TON with the currency you deposited (e.g., USD, BTC, or ETH).
4. **Withdraw $TON to Your Wallet**:
   * After buying $TON, go to the **withdrawal section** of the exchange.
   * Enter your **TON wallet address** (from Step 2).
   * Confirm the withdrawal. Make sure to double-check that your address is correct to avoid losing funds.
   * Some exchanges might ask for additional confirmation steps, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), for security.
5. **Wait for the Transfer to Complete**:
   * After the withdrawal is initiated, it may take a few minutes to a couple of hours for the $TON tokens to arrive in your wallet, depending on the exchange and network conditions.

#### **Method 2: Receiving $TON from Another User**

If you have someone else send you $TON (e.g., from a friend or colleague), here's what to do:

1. **Share Your Wallet Address**: Provide your **TON wallet address** to the sender.
2. **Have Them Send the $TON**: The sender can transfer $TON to your wallet using your address.
3. **Check Your Wallet**: After the transfer is made, open your wallet app to check for the incoming transaction. This could take a few minutes, depending on network congestion.

## Step 3: Verify the Transfer

Once your $TON has been sent to your wallet:

1. Open the **TON Wallet** app.
2. Navigate to the **balance** section to see your incoming $TON tokens.
3. You should see the deposit appear after a few minutes

## Step 4: Keep Your $TON Safe

* **Backup your wallet**: Ensure your recovery phrase is safely stored in a secure place offline.
* **Double-check addresses**: Always confirm you are using the correct TON wallet address when sending or receiving $TON to avoid any mistakes.
* **Enable additional security**: If possible, enable features like **two-factor authentication (2FA)** on any exchange accounts you use for added protection.
