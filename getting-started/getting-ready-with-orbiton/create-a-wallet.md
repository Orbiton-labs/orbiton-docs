Creating a wallet on The Open Network (TON) is a straightforward process, and itâ€™s essential for interacting with the TON blockchain. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to create a wallet on TON using a popular method, such as using the TON Wallet app or a web-based wallet. These instructions will help you securely manage your TON assets.

## Step 1: Choose Your Wallet Type

TON supports different types of wallets, including:

* **Software Wallets**: Apps you can install on your phone or computer.
* **Web Wallets**: Accessed through a browser, often convenient but with slightly lower security.
* **Hardware Wallets**: Physical devices that store your private keys offline (most secure, but requires additional setup).

For this guide, we'll focus on creating a wallet using the **TON Wallet App**, which is a popular software wallet for the TON blockchain.

## Step 2: Install the TON Wallet App

1. **Download the TON Wallet App**:
   * **For Android**: Go to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) and search for "TON Wallet" or download it directly from the official TON website.
   * **For iOS**: Open the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) and search for "TON Wallet."
2. **Install the app** and launch it once it's finished downloading.

## Step 3: Create a New Wallet

1. **Open the Wallet App**: After launching the app, you will be given a few options. Select **"Create a new wallet."**
2. **Set Your Security PIN**: To ensure your wallet is secure, youâ€™ll be prompted to create a **4-digit PIN**. This PIN will be used whenever you access your wallet.
3. **Generate Your Seed Phrase**: The most crucial part of creating your wallet is generating a **12-word recovery phrase** (also called a "seed phrase"). This phrase acts as a backup in case you ever lose access to your wallet. Write down these words and store them in a safe, secure place (preferably offline). **Do not share this seed phrase with anyone**.
4. **Confirm Your Seed Phrase**: After youâ€™ve written down your seed phrase, the app will ask you to confirm it by selecting the words in the correct order. This step is to ensure youâ€™ve correctly saved your recovery phrase.

## Step 4: Set Up Your Wallet

Once the wallet is created, you will be directed to your walletâ€™s main screen. At this point:

* **Your wallet address** will be displayed. This is the public address you will use to receive TON coins and interact with the TON blockchain.
* You will be able to view your wallet balance, recent transactions, and perform other functions such as sending or receiving TON.

## Step 5: Secure Your Wallet

1. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (Optional)**: If the wallet app supports it, consider enabling additional security features like **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for extra protection.
2. **Backup Your Seed Phrase**: As mentioned earlier, the most important thing to secure is your seed phrase. If you ever lose access to your device, your seed phrase will allow you to restore access to your wallet.

## Step 6: Fund Your Wallet

Once your wallet is created, you can start using it to interact with the TON blockchain:

1. **Receive TON**: Use the wallet address to receive TON coins or tokens from other users or platforms.
2. **Send TON**: You can also send TON to others by entering their wallet address and the amount you want to send.
