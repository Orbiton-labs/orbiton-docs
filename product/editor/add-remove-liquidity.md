1. **Select Token Pair**: Orbiton will prompt you to select the **token pair** you wish to add to the pool. You’ll need to choose two tokens (e.g., **$TON and $USDT**) to provide liquidity for. These tokens will form a pair in the liquidity pool.

## **Tips for Adding/Removing Liquidity on Orbiton**

* **Impermanent Loss**: When you add liquidity, keep in mind that there’s a risk of **impermanent loss**, which occurs if the price of the tokens in the pool changes significantly. This is a risk to consider before providing liquidity, as it could affect the total value of your assets.
* **Concentrated Liquidity**: Orbiton uses a **CLAMM (Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker)** model, which allows you to concentrate your liquidity within specific price ranges. This means you can optimize your liquidity provision for higher returns but also have more control over the price ranges.
* **Monitor Your Liquidity**: Regularly check your liquidity pool position to monitor how much you’re earning from trading fees and whether it's more beneficial to add or remove liquidity based on market conditions.
* **Transaction Fees**: When removing liquidity, consider that there may be **transaction fees** associated with withdrawing tokens. Be sure to check the fees before confirming your actions.
