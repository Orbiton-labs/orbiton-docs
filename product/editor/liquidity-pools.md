A **liquidity pool** on **Orbiton**, the decentralized exchange (DEX) mini-app on Telegram, is a vital part of how decentralized trading works. It’s essentially a collection of funds—often in the form of tokens—deposited into a smart contract by users like you. These funds provide the liquidity necessary for trades to happen on the DEX.

In traditional exchanges, buyers and sellers match orders in real-time, which can sometimes lead to slow transactions or price slippage. However, in decentralized exchanges like Orbiton, liquidity pools solve this problem by providing constant liquidity, enabling users to trade tokens seamlessly without relying on an order book system.

Orbiton uses **CLAMM (Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker)** for its liquidity pools, which provides additional benefits over standard market-making systems, improving efficiency for both liquidity providers (LPs) and traders.

#### How Liquidity Pools Work on Orbiton

1. **Providing Liquidity**:
   * Users, known as **liquidity providers (LPs)**, deposit pairs of tokens (e.g., $TON and $USDT) into the liquidity pool. By doing this, they contribute to the exchange's overall liquidity, allowing other users to swap tokens instantly.
2. **Swapping Tokens**:
   * When someone wants to swap tokens on Orbiton, the DEX will access these liquidity pools to execute the trade. This enables fast and efficient token swaps without the need for a traditional order book system.
3. **CLAMM (Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker)**:
   * Orbiton utilizes the **CLAMM** model, which allows liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity within specific price ranges rather than distributing it evenly across the entire price curve. This concentrated liquidity enables LPs to provide deeper liquidity at the price levels they choose, leading to better trade execution and lower slippage for users.
   * The **CLAMM** mechanism is more efficient than traditional AMMs because it allows liquidity to be used more effectively. LPs have more control over their liquidity and can earn higher returns from smaller price ranges, while traders benefit from reduced slippage and improved pricing.
4. **Earning Fees**:
   * In return for providing liquidity, LPs earn a **share of the trading fees**. When other users perform swaps using the liquidity pool, a small fee is charged, and these fees are distributed proportionally to the liquidity providers based on the amount of liquidity they’ve contributed to the pool.

#### Benefits of Liquidity Pools on Orbiton

* **Earn Passive Income**: By providing liquidity, you can earn trading fees passively without having to actively trade.
* **Improved Trade Execution**: Liquidity pools help reduce slippage and ensure smoother trades, especially for larger orders, by maintaining a stable pool of tokens.
* **CLAMM Efficiency**: The **CLAMM** model improves liquidity efficiency by allowing liquidity to be concentrated within specific price ranges, offering LPs better returns on their liquidity and traders better pricing.
* **Decentralized and Trustless**: Since liquidity pools are based on smart contracts, transactions are transparent, secure, and decentralized, with no middlemen involved.

#### Conclusion

Liquidity pools on Orbiton offer a simple yet powerful way for users to participate in the decentralized exchange ecosystem while earning rewards. The **CLAMM (Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker)** model enhances liquidity provision by allowing liquidity to be concentrated within specific price ranges, leading to better capital efficiency and improved pricing for trades. By adding tokens to a liquidity pool, you not only contribute to the growth of the TON ecosystem but also unlock the potential for passive income through trading fees. Whether you’re a seasoned DeFi user or new to the space, liquidity pools on Orbiton provide an easy and rewarding way to engage with the decentralized finance world.
