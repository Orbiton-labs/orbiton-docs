1. **Select the Token You Want to Swap**:
   * Choose the token you wish to **swap from**.
   * This could be **$TON** or any other token supported on Orbiton.
   * Enter the name of the token or select it from a list provided.
2. **Select the Token You Want to Receive**:
   * Next, Orbiton will ask you to choose the token you wish to receive in exchange.
   * For example, if you're swapping **$TON** for $**USDT**, select $**USDT** (or any other token you want to receive).
   * You can choose from a range of supported tokens within the Orbiton DEX.

1. **Specify the Amount**:
   * Once you've selected the tokens for the swap, Orbiton will ask you to enter the **amount** of the token you want to swap.
   * For example, if you're swapping **$TON**, type in how many **TON tokens** you want to exchange.
   * Orbiton will usually display the estimated amount of the token you will receive based on current rates.
2. **Check Fees**:
   * Be aware that swaps on decentralized exchanges typically involve **transaction fees** (known as gas fees) or a small fee for the swap. This fee is 0.05% per swap.

#### Step 5: Confirm the Swap

1. **Review the Details**:
   * Orbiton will show you a summary of the swap:
     * The token you're swapping (e.g., **$TON**).
     * The amount you're swapping.
     * The token you're receiving (e.g., $**USDT**).
     * Any fees associated with the transaction.
2. **Confirm the Swap**:
   * After reviewing the details, Orbiton will ask you to confirm the swap.
   * **Confirm** by typing **“Yes”** or following the prompt given by Orbiton.
3. **Authenticate the Swap**:
   * Depending on your wallet’s security settings, you might be asked to confirm the swap by entering your **PIN** or completing a **transaction signing** step.
   * This is a security feature to ensure the swap is initiated by you.

#### Step 6: Wait for the Transaction to Complete

1. **Processing the Swap**:
   * Once you confirm the swap, the bot will initiate the transaction on the TON blockchain. This may take a few moments to complete.
   * The bot will show a **transaction status** (pending, completed, etc.), and you will be notified when the swap is successful.
2. **Check Your Wallet**:
   * After the transaction is confirmed, the swapped tokens will be sent to your **TON Wallet**.
   * You can check your wallet balance by opening the **TON Wallet** app and ensuring the received token is now available.

***

#### Step 7: Review the Swap Details

**View the Swap History**:

* Orbiton will also show you the **transaction history**, including details of the swap you just performed.
* You can always check the **transaction ID** (TXID) for more information about the transaction on the TON blockchain.

***

#### Step 8: Repeat or Withdraw Tokens

1. **Make More Swaps**:
   * You can continue swapping tokens by repeating the steps above.
2. **Withdraw Tokens (Optional)**:
   * If you want to move your tokens from Orbiton to another wallet, you can initiate a **withdrawal** from the DEX.
   * Follow the bot’s prompts to withdraw funds back to your TON Wallet.
